- use sed rather perl to do inline replaces (as perl ignores inexistent files)
- removed no-longer-needed inline edits
- fixed /etc/httpd ownership (main pkg no longer needs apxs)
- fixed build dir ownerships (main vs apxs vs devel)
- main requires mod_version, so you can always use that module (write
  compatible configs for different versions, sadly 2.2.+ only (for now?))
