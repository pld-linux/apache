__FILE__ expands to the full pathname during VPATH builds; this
clutters up the debug log (and also bloats binaries very slightly).
The -pie patch defines AP_FNAME during build which is equivalent
to basename(__FILE__); use that for debug logging where available.

AP_FNAME uses $(notdir ...), a GNU make extension, so this can't
go upstream.

Note this patch depends on the pie patch.
