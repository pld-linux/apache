	# ScriptAlias: This controls which directories contain server scripts.
	# ScriptAliases are essentially the same as Aliases, except that
	# documents in the target directory are treated as applications and
	# run by the server when requested rather than as documents sent to the
	# client.  The same rules about trailing "/" apply to ScriptAlias
	# directives as to Alias.
